## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Last week accomplishments included reading the documentation on pytest and getting familiar with how it works

## This Week's Plan

> My plan for this week is to continue research on pytest and begin making some small test files to run pytest. The ultimate goal is to make a file to make sure that all of our data was parsed correctly.

## Anything Blocking?

>I have had problems getting my docker image set up I have been getting an error that says i do not have permission to access the image. i have spent a couple of hours trying to figure it out but to no avail.
