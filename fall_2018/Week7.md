## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Last weeks accomplishments include continuing learning more of pytest and getting used to how to integrate the testing for our project. I did not get to start any code yet for the project but I hope to be able to understand how to make the code for the project.

## This Week's Plan

>This weeks plan is to continue to hammer out at learning and becoming effcient with pytest. I hope to begin some of the code hopfeully by the end of the semester. 

## Anything Blocking?

>Like always Im not able to run any of the Django code on my laptop due to permission errors. Even after talking to all of my group members they had no fix for it. 
## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
