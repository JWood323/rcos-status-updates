## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

>This Past week I spent most of my time getting the presentation finished. I also continued writing some practice test code to better my skills. I am still new to writing test code for a larger project like this so it is taking some getting used to. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

This next week I am going to continue trying to better my testing skills and also hopefully soon I will be able to begin implementing it into our code. We are also still trying to nail down some things so I am waiting until we have somethings set in stone.  

## Anything Blocking?

>Limited expierence with testing, and also cant get permissions to use django for some reason. 
## Notes
