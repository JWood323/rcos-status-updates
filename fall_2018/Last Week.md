## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I helped work on the presentaiton for our project. I also began doing some documentation on the project. This is includiong going through most of the files and giving descriptions on the code so future students on the project can get an understanding on how the code functions.

## Semester Recap
This past semester has been a great learning expierence for me. When I took RCOS last semester I worked on a project where the lead guy wanted to write the functioning code and already had most of it written prior to the start of RCOS. So there wasn't really that much to do as far as code wise. So this semester was beneficial because this project was basically started from scratch for the most part. At the beginning of the semester I spent alot of time learning about how Django worked and how it was used in our project. But at after learning this I tried to use Django on my laptop and because of permission eroors I could not get it to run on my laptop. I consulted my group about it and also talked to Ranjit and we couldn't figure it out. After this I began to look into PostgreSQL because we were using it for our database.( I was on the database team and also testing). I did a couple of tutoirials on this as well, one of them was http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/. After we got the databse set up I began working on learning PyTest becuase we were using that for the testing of our project. I spent a week or two learning and understanding the syntax. I then wrote a couple of small tutorial tests that were on pytest.org. By this time in the semester in was nearing the end so I then helped with Documentation for future students and also helped with our presentation. I hopfully look forward to posssibly joining this team again next semester now that I know how the code works.

## Anything Blocking
One thing that blocked a lot of my semester was Django not working on my computer because of this I couldn't directly write the code that used Django.
